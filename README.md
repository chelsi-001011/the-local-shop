## Inctroduction
Our objective was to help the people fetch their daily essentials from Local stores without having to step out. With this we aim at promoting the Local stores and help out people who have no one at home to get daily grocery and other stuff.
Our method of implementation was building an app that will be handy for both the parties, the customer and the seller. We wanted to incorporate all the products and serivces that we require, and build something that fulfils the need of the people.
We came up with four categories which were -
* Food/Eatables
* Grocery
* Medicine
* Services

## Technology
Our application is android based, it uses the following technologies and developement environments.
* Android Studio
* Java
* XML
* Google Firebase
* Mapbox SDK for Android
